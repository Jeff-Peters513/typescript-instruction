2. bowling project - create a Typescript project that simulates a game of bowling....   Prompt the user with "Wanna Bowl?".  When they enter 'Y', generate 10 random #s (for 10 frames) between 1 and 10.  Your app should print those frame scores to the screen and then display a total.  If you get geeked out by this and want to enhance it to take into account true bowling rules (think strikes, spares, and bonus roll in frame 10) go for it!
